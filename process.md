#  Tackling the problem through real stories


It is often proven to me that in order to map stories and communicate visions in a way that is memorable and allows stakeholders to identify with the “user" rather data  and in this way understand the context and the goals we need to achieve. Sketching also increases the memorising and understanding of a journey’s key moments by combining multiple complex elements into a single idea through story telling. Rather than tax our cognitive load by trying to integrate complex and often repetitive information from multiple data sources, we can can focus on bringing the story to life and see its resolution.
