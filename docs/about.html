    <h1 id="about-page">About page</h1>

<p>I have recently moved to Montreal after spending 20 years in the London (UK) technology, brand and startup and industries to work as a Product Experience Designer. My career has evolved across a range of disciplines including UX design, front-end development, agile coach and technical delivery. Over the years I have combined this experience with my artistic background to communicate solutions for great products using a design sprint approach and visual story telling through sketching as a platform for UX and technical deliverables.</p>

<p>Having delivered consumer and B2B products  spanning across enterprise software, food and beverage, beauty , sports , automotive, fintech and broadcast television, I realised that a lot of time, energy and budget is spent unnecessarily. Long meetings, expensive, lengthy customer research, market analysis and benchmarking take weeks, often  before products are delivered, let alone prototyped and tested. Large stakeholder teams with complicated hierarchical positions with varying perspectives drag project deliverables endlessly as a result of poor communication and conflicting decision power and business goals.</p>

<p>The result is projects that are lengthy, costly, unnecessarily bulky and designed for audiences who may or may not be their resulting intended target by the time they are launched.</p>

<p>My time spent both with young startups and large corporations enabled me to see this problem at large and microlevels. One thing that stood however, given my background in agile and UX  design is that the best way to communicate and validate products was by implementing short Design Sprints and sketching done over quick iterations with the collaboration of small projects teams and our combined assumption to tell product stories by the means of rough prototypes which can be tested fast in front of a small audience before any complex project scope and research have been decided.</p>

<p>Many innovative “startups” are living  proof of this method be it intentionally or accidentally having to work with little or no budget against ridiculous deadlines. Sketching and story telling are not only cost effective and rapid to produce but they are an instructive and incite focus and creativity in an universal manner. It enables  engineers, product owners, designers, stakeholder and users to visualise and align together towards an awesome product experience.</p>
